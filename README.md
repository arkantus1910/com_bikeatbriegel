Joomla 3.1 component for Bike @ Briegel
This component will be the main component for our (small) cycling team.
It will allow users to do these actions:
 - [registred user] Plan a cycling activity
 - [registred user] Log a past cycling activity
 - [registred user] Add a GPX-file to a logged activity, so a google map with the route is shown.
 - [registred user] Add a HRM-file to a logged activity, so hearthrate/speed/altitude is added to a route.
 - [registred user] Specify if a user will join a planned activity or not.
 - [registred user] Modify their logged and planned activities.
 - [registred user] Add additional fields to the profile (Avatar, birthday, mobile phone)
 - [registred user] Add comments to a planned and logged activity
 - [everyone]       View a past logged activity.
 - [everyone]       View the member list (e-mail and mobile phone only to 'registred users')
 - [everyone]       View a members profile (e-mail and mobile phone only to 'registred users')
